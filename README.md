# NASA-photo-search

## Description

Our project is to use the NASA API to display the picture of the day, and then have a search function that allows a user to search the photo website for NASA by keyword and returns the and display photos.  The "View Previous search" button opens a modal and shows previous search terms stored locally.

## User Story

As a User I want to be able to load images from NASA's APIs so that I can get the picture of the day
I also want to be able to search for photos using keywords in a search bar and have those saved locally

## Acceptance Criteria
When user loads page, then they are present with NASA's astronomy photo of the day (APOD)
When the user clicks the search button, then they are brought to a search page
When the user types in the search bar, then they are shown pictures based on their search
When the user searches an item, then that item is stored in local storage to be accessed later
