# NASA-photo-search

## Description

My proposal for our project is to use the NASA API to display the picture of the day, and then have a search function that allows a user to search the photo website for NASA by keyword and returns the photos.  The search function upon typing would show previous search terms stored locally.

## User Story

As a User I want to be able to load images from NASA's APIs so that I can get the picture of the day
I also want to be able to search for photos using keywords in a search bar and have those saved locally
